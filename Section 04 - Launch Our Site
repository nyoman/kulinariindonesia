Section 04 - Launch our Site
----------------------------

A.	Set Up Github

	STEPS:

	1. 

Creating An Account On Github (if you do not have yet)

	1.	Go Github

		> Open github.com
		> Create an account (if you do not have it yet)
		> Create a new repository + name + description
		>> Create ssh key
		> goole: github ssh key
		> help.github.com
		
		>> Follow the instructions

		Step 1: Check for SSH keys

			>>	Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key. 
			    By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

				id_dsa.pub
				id_ecdsa.pub
				id_ed25519.pub
				id_rsa.pub

			>	ls -al ~/.ssh
				
			>> result

				ings-Mac:yelpdemo ing$ ls -al ~/.ssh
				total 24
				drwx------   5 ing  staff   170 Dec 28 00:44 .
				drwxr-xr-x+ 23 ing  staff   782 Dec 28 19:56 ..
				-rw-------   1 ing  staff  1766 Dec 28 00:31 id_rsa
				-rw-r--r--   1 ing  staff   408 Dec 28 00:31 id_rsa.pub
				-rw-r--r--   1 ing  staff   803 Dec 29 08:29 known_hosts
				ings-Mac:yelpdemo ing$ 

			>> copy and paste this from help.github.com
			> 	pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub + enter
				NOTE: you will not see the result, but keep going to github and paste it there
			> 	github > ssh key
			>	paste it
			>	confirm password: asdfjkl;G235

			>> do these:

			echo "# Yeldemo" >> README.md
			git init
			git add README.md
			git commit -m "first commit"
			git remote add origin git@github.com:nyoman/Yeldemo.git
			git push -u origin master

			> git init
			> git status
			> git add .
			> git commit -m "first commit"
			> git remote add origin git@github.com:nyoman/Yeldemo.git
			>> ENTER id_rsa PASSWORD
				nyoman
			> git push -u origin master
			:)	



1.	Starting Git On OSX El Capitan

	> Open a new terminal
	> git --version
	> to agree the xcode agreement
	> agree

-------ON WINDOWS-------



A	Set Up Github
	-------------

	STEPS:

	1 Learning to save codes by using Git Version Control System (VCS), called 'Git'

		Git VCS allow us to track our progress using save points.

		Git creates a new save point by making copy each of out code files
		at that moment in time.

		This create us code history time lines.
		In case we made a mistake or some mistakes, we wil be able to revert to earlier save point.


	2 Upload our site to github

		Github website on the other hand, is a hub to store out git codes file on line.

		On Github, every application created store in different repository.

		Every time we save out work with git and upload our files, the code in repository get updated.

		Unless, we pay for privacy, our code will be able to access by any one.

		This is allow us to collaborate with friends on a project with single-code based.


		1 	Create an account on Github (if dont have it)

		2	> github.com

		3	> create ssh key (only one time, if had it, no need ot have it again)

			NOTE FOR WINDOWS USER:

			- When you installed ROR for the first time or when you used Github for the first time,
			  it means you have already SSH key.

			NOTE FOR MAC USER:
			
			- Follow the instructions:

			> google: githu ssh key

			> https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys   

			STEPS:

			0 > help.githu.com
			1 > Check for SSH Key 
			2 > Generate a new SSH Key
			3 > Add you SSH to Github



B	Save Our Progress And Upload Our Code on Github
	-----------------------------------------------


	STEPS:

	1 Principle

		Add new repository for every new project

	2 Add name on Repositoty name

		> write name
		> clike the button

	3 In the terminal window initialize the git
	
		> git init	

	4 On Githuh, copy the code bellow
	
		> git remote add origin git@github.com:nyoman/kulinari-indonesia.git
		> paste it on terminal window

	5 On terminal window check git status to check which files were chenged when last time you saved

		> git status

	6 Add all the changes to app directory that are ready to be saved
	
		> git add .

			Note: . = all files in the current directory

		>> See the changes been made
		
			> git status	

			Note: you will see green color of the codes that were added to version control

	7 Run git commit to save all the files that been save to version control
	
		> git commit -m "First commit"		

			Note: this command will copy all files in the version control

	8 Push or Upload the files to Github
	
		>> Github: copy this code and paste it on terminal window

			> git push -u origin master 

				Note: All files have been uploaded on Github

				>> Go and see the files on Github
			
			> click : nyoman/kulinari indonesia
			
			DONE!


	9 REPEATING TO PRACTICE
	
		>> Make some changes on you files and push them on Github

		> git status
		> git add . 
		> git commit -m "Update About page"
		> git push


C.	Deploy On Heroku
	----------------
		
		>> google: get started with heroku

		Steps (4):

		1 Sign Up / Log In

		2 Setup -> download Heroku Toolbelt

			> install it on you system
			>> follow the instruction

		3 To start after the installion
		
			> heroku login
			> enter your email and password that you used on signed up on heroku

				Note: if there was a problem, go to: devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys

		4 Deploy the app on heroku (final step)
		
			>> github: https://github.com/nyoman/kulinari-indonesia

				>> copy ssh link: git@github.com:nyoman/kulinari-indonesia.git

				> git@github.com:nyoman/kulinari-indonesia.git
				> cd kulinari-indonesia
