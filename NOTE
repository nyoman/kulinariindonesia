CREATING YELPDEMO SITE
----------------------

1 Create the app

	> rails new yelpdemo

2 Add First Pages

	> rails g controller Pages about contact
	> http://localhost:3000/pages/about	
	> Add copyrights / footer	

3 Add Links

	> 	<a href="/pages/about">About</a>
		<a href="/pages/contact">Contact</a>

	> 	Add those links on layouts/application file	

	> 	Move copy right / footer to layouts/application file	


4 Add Restaurants (With Database)

	> rails g scaffold Restaurant name:string address:string phone:string website:string

	NOTE:

	-	The above instruction created a lot of files, one of of them is 
		db/migrate.

		We call that file MIGRATION

	-	We added Restaurant, we need to have 
		database to store information about them.	

	-	We gave rails instruction of what data to store. 
		And this is called MIGRATION.	

	-	Any change made to the database, whether we add new field,
		or changing the existing field, we have to create a new migration.	

	-	The Migration, always need 3 steps proccess:
	
		1. 	Generate the migration on rails

		2.	rake db:migrate

			It is about to take the instruction from the migration and run them
			by creating database table or new columns that we wanted.

		3.	Re-run the server

	>> Test the browser

		> http://localhost:3000/restaurants/new

		>>> Add some data:

			Restauran 1
			Blok G2 No 35, BTN Bambu Kuning, BJGD, BGR
			021 11111
			restaurant1@restauran.com

5	Set Up The Home Page

	>> In the routes files, add:

		>   root 'restaurants#index'

	>> Checking the route paths

		> rake routes
